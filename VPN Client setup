  Linux (Strongswan plugin for NetworkManager)
Most of Linux desktop distros uses Network manager by default and Strongswan (for IKE2 functionality) plugin for Network Manager is readily available in official repositories:

    Arch Linux: networkmanager-strongswan
    Debian: network-manager-strongswan
    Fedora: strongswan-charon-nm


Below guide is based on Fedora 34, Gnome DE using integrated IKE2 (Strongswan) support in Gnome:

1. Prepare certificates (Gnome/NetworkManager accepts only PEM certificates and not PKCS12)


# Become root
sudo su

# Create directory "/opt/vpn/home"
mkdir -p /opt/vpn/home

# Upload .p12 file to "/opt/vpn/home" directory...

# Change cwd to "/opt/vpn/home"
cd /opt/vpn/home/

# Extract PEM certificates (private key, certificate and CA)
openssl pkcs12 -in "Home client1.p12" -nocerts -nodes | sed -ne '/-BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-/,/-END PRIVATE KEY-/p' > "Home client1 key.pem"
openssl pkcs12 -in "Home client1.p12" -clcerts -nokeys | sed -ne '/-BEGIN CERTIFICATE-/,/-END CERTIFICATE-/p' > "Home client1 cert.pem"
openssl pkcs12 -in "Home client1.p12" -cacerts -nokeys -chain | sed -ne '/-BEGIN CERTIFICATE-/,/-END CERTIFICATE-/p' > "Home client1 CA.pem"

# Enforce permissions (to make sure strongswan/networkmanager can read these files)
chmod -R 755 /opt/vpn
chown -R root:root /opt/vpn



2. Go to Gnome settings --> Network --> VPN --> "+" button --> "IPsec/IKEv2 (strongswan)" choice.
3. Enter/Select the following details:

    Server->Name: Home
    Server->Address: XXXXXXXXXXX.sn.mynetname.net
    Server->Certificate: Select "Home client1 CA.pem" file
    Server->Identity: Empty
    Client->Port: Empty
    Client->Authentication: Certificate
    Client->Certificate: Certificate/private key
    Client->Certificate file: Select "Home client1 cert.pem" file
    Client->Private key: Select "Home client1 key.pem" file
    Client->Identity: Empty
    Options->Request an inner IP address: Checked
    Options->Enforce UDP encapsulation: Unchecked
    Options->Use IP compression: Unchecked
    Cipher proposals->Enable custom proposals: Checked
    Cipher proposals->IKE: aes256-sha256-prfsha256-modp1024
    Cipher proposals->ESP: aes256-sha1

4. Click Save.
